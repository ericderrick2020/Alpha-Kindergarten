                <h1>NUTRITION</h1>
                <p>We are all aware of the huge importance of good nutrition in terms of your child's health and the
                    nursery prides itself on the quality of the food. Our aim is to give your child the very best start.
                    We keep up to date with current government recommendations on early years diet as we are very aware
                    of how important it is.. Our three weekly menus are changed seasonally and prepared using Eat Better
                    Do Better guidance to ensure that all our children get the most out of each meal nutritionally.
                    Freshly cooked on-site by our own cook, all of our mouth watering meals use locally sourced produce
                    where possible - without any salt, limiting sugar and incorporating at least five servings of fruit
                    and vegetables each day. We understand that at nursery age, children are much more likely to try
                    more foods, although this will change very quickly as they grow up. Treating meal times as a social
                    occasion, children get the opportunity to improve their social development whilst developing
                    concepts such as table manners and trying new foods. Older children help to set the table and serve
                    themselves. Parents are often amazed at what their "fussy eaters" will eat when in the company of
                    their peers at nursery.</p>

                <h1>OUR CURRICULUM</h1>
                <p>Our welcoming, friendly and spacious nursery provides the ideal environment for our children
                    throughout the day; stimulating environments which provide opportunities for children to relax in
                    quiet areas, learn and engage in play. Our babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers are split into five
                    age groups based in separate rooms, progressing to the next group when they are developmentally
                    ready. Each child and their family is supported by a keyperson, working in partnership to follow
                    their child's development and set developmental "Next Steps" following the children's interests and
                    The Early Years Foundation Stage Framework. To ensure that continuity of care is provided, their key
                    person works towards building a partnership with parents to keep them informed of their child's
                    needs and to support any changes in family and home life. We strive to provide a happy, friendly and
                    stimulating atmosphere, where children can develop at their own pace and reach their full potential
                    in a secure and personal setting. The age ranges in rooms may vary due to the individual
                    developmental needs of each child.</p>

                <h1>FACILITIES</h1>
                <p>The Kind of education we offer helps the youngones to get out their home environment. We help them to
                    learn how to interact with other people other than their family members. We build self esteem in the
                    children, teach our children proper etiquette like sharing, cleanliness, potty training, table
                    manners, and being polite when dealing with each other. The School gives due consideration to
                    buliding and stretching pupils' physical capabilities and 'Health Of Mind' through participation in
                    co-curricular activities such as: Swimming, School Trips, Music dance and Drama, Games and Sports.
                    Sports Uniform is put on twice a week, that is: Tuesday and Friday
